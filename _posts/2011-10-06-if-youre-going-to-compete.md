I watched [Steve’s Q&A session at WWDC 1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LEXae1j6EY&feature=youtu.be) this morning.

He gets a lot of questions from an audience skeptical about Apple’s future. Skeptical that their competitors were going to run them over. Skeptical that Wintel was too dominant to take on (in 1997, I don’t blame them for thinking that way).

He talks about how when he started Apple, IBM was the dominant player in the market. Steve and Woz didn’t care, and started on with Apple anyway. But not because they were ignorant of who IBM was - but because they knew IBM products were bad and they could build something 10 times better.

In startups, you see a lot of also-rans. I probably can’t even count the foursquare also-rans on two hands. Their mistake wasn’t trying to create a location-based social network at the same time foursquare was - their mistake was not making their product 10x better than foursquare. Steve knew competition didn’t matter if you were doing it 10x better. I don’t think anyone respects that multiple more than Steve did.

10x is fucking hard. Adding “gamification” is not 10x. Adding “social features” is not 10x. Adding “deals” is not 10x.

If you’re going to compete, compete with a 10x better product.
