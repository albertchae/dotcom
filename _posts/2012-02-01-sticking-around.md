A lot of people in the startup community miss the value of long time windows. It frees you up to do a lot of long-term acting and thinking.

I’ve just seen way too many people come to a meetup or three, talk the big game about this awesome cool startup they’re doing, then fall off the earth six months later. They stop tweeting, stop checking in on Foursquare, and probably end up in some banking job behind a desk somewhere.

Your first entrepreneurial venture is absolutely not “make it or break it.” If I had given up after being humiliated on national television with Shark Tank, I wouldn’t have done all the awesome stuff I’m doing with Tech@NYU right now enabling student entrepreneurship.

I’ve only seen people succeed after sticking around for a long period of time. Putting in the hours. Showing up at the meetups for years, not months. Learning to code over two or three years. Building velocity with lots of little successful mini-projects rather than doing one “startup” and flaming out.

I’ve seen it at Tech@NYU with Hursh Agrawal’s success after years of “showing up” at Tech@NYU events. I’m seeing a similar pattern develop in several other of our newer Tech@NYU members that just seem to be at every event: Misha Ponizil, Michael Bartnett, Jeremiah Malina. Maybe it’ll be another year, maybe two - but I know all these guys are going to succeed because they’re putting in the hours.

I’m four years into my startup journey now, when I first started going to Graham Lawlor’s Ultra Light Startup meetups (oh, he still runs them, of course. Back then it was 30 attendees, now it’s over 200). Steve Jobs was in tech for 10 years before he released the Mac, 30 years when he launched the iPhone.

Not investing in yourself because you “don’t have time” is the worst excuse any startup-focused person can give. I’d probably be unemployed right now if I hadn’t spent the last year learning to code.

So think ahead. Really ahead.
