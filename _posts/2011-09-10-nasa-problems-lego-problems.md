NASA problems require many years and massive teams to solve. It took us over 10 years and 21 manned missions to gain enough knowledge and experience to send a man to the moon. That’s a lot of work.

Making a rocket of out LEGO, comparatively, is trivial. Even if it’s a really big one - like 5 feet tall - it would take maybe 8 hours if you had a few friends. It maybe even will feel like a lot of work. How many times do you sit down and do something for 8 hours straight? Sheesh!

But compare the LEGO rocket to the NASA rocket. It took 24 man-hours to build a rocket out of LEGO. It took us millions of man-years to build a real rocket that could take people to the moon.

Too many startups think they’re solving NASA problems when they’re really solving LEGO problems. When you’ve never run a company before, everything seems like a massive challenge which has never been surmounted before. You feel like no one else could ever surmount that same mountain you did. But you’re wrong. They will - as soon as you start making real money, they’ll come in droves.

Don’t lie to yourself. If you’re solving LEGO problems, the competitors will come. Better to be ready.

Technical risk need not be an all-or-nothing proposition - it can also include the risk that a certain technical requirement cannot be achieved with any great efficiency or without the application of tremendous manpower, resources, and time.

## Why do we overestimate technical risk?

Inexperience is a major factor. When you’ve never built a startup before, everything seems 10x more difficult than anything else you’ve ever attempted before (because, well, it is). It becomes difficult to conceive of someone working on something 10x harder than that (a 100x increase in total). If you’ve never worked on a team that was trying to solve something extremely difficult from a technical perspective, you have no frame of reference and you might think that a three-month-long Rails project is the pinnacle of human achievement.

A LEGO rocket seemed hard to build, but once you’ve built a Saturn V the LEGO rocket seems a lot less difficult. Most beginning entrepreneurs have only built LEGO rockets.

Overestimators of technical risk also tend to overuse the word “disruptive.”

## What happens when technical risk is overestimated?

Believing that your technical risk is greater than it is leads you to make mistakes when evaluating competition. You believe your startup is more innovative or more difficult to copy than it actually is.

I think perhaps a few flight search startups are reeling after Google released Google Flight Search, realizing that what they’ve built was fairly easy to copy (and fairly easy for Google to improve upon).

## You don’t have to solve a NASA problem

It’s OK to solve LEGO-size problems! A lot of great companies have been built off of simple technologies. Most “technology startups” are fancy frontends for manipulating records in a database (Twitter, anyone?). The key is to realize that CRUD is not a major technological breakthrough, and what you are doing can be copied or spun off and as soon as it’s clear you’re popular you will attract some smart competition.

If you’re not solving a hard problem, realize that and prepare yourself. You can build barriers to entry that aren’t technological - so get started on that and don’t use the notion that “what we’ve done is difficult to copy because X, Y…” as an excuse not to hustle.
