Hello loyal readers!

I've decided to brand my consulting and Ruby performance work under a new name:
[Speedshop](https://speedshop.co). All of the blog content that was previously hosted here has been moved to
[the Speedshop blog](https://speedshop.co/blog), and that's where I'll be posting about Ruby performance in the future. Please update your RSS readers accordingly, but note that the Newsletter will still link to the new site.

I also created this new site/identity to allow me to blog about more general topics here. Don't worry, this is still a programming/Ruby focused blog, but anything I post here probably won't strictly be performance related. To give you an idea, here's some topics in the queue that I plan on posting here, at nateberkopec.com:

* Why I try to minimize JavaScript on my sites
* Why I'm an avid user of the `chruby` project instead of `rvm` or `rbenv`
* A post about the general arc of my programming career
* A teardown of the Complete Guide
* A post about the philosophy of Minitest, as revealed through code
* Diving in to the modularity of Rails
* Investigating the phenomenon of "brutalist" web design
* An overview of the state of the Ruby ecosystem

If that sort of content interests you, I encourage you to stay subscribed to my newsletter and keep this site in your RSS reader - otherwise, feel free to join me at [Speedshop](https://speedshop.co).
