For those unfamiliar with Markov chains and find [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) slightly dense, imagine this:

Take every TechCrunch article and randomly switch one word with another, one word at a time. Repeat this process an infinite number of times, and you have, according to Paul Graham, an (average) YCombinator application.

Yesterday, I tweeted:

I was surprised that a reference to several highly technical or less-than-well-known thinkers would resonate with so many people. I wondered what startups would look like if instead of Markov chaining TechCrunch, you did a kind of [drunkard’s walk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk) through a corpus of business theorists, systems scientists, philosophers, and artists and let a startup pop out the other side.

I’m a pretty voracious reader of post-18th century philosophy - I spent most of my semester abroad (struggling) with Wittgenstein’s [Tractacus Logico-Philosophicus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus). After reading The Lean Startup, I made sure to read the thinkers that inspired Eric Ries like Peter Drucker and John Boyd.

Some people might think this is a little “bookish” or having little practical application. I think the exact opposite.Startups are systems, and a ton of people have written about systems. Thermodynamics is a system. Mathematics is a system. Systems are literally [everywhere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_science).

John Boyd, in his short essay [Creation and Destruction](http://www.goalsys.com/books/documents/DESTRUCTION_AND_CREATION.pdf), describes the relationship between inductive and deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning (destruction) encompasses analysis and understanding the building blocks of larger concepts. Inductive reasoning (creation) is recombining those building blocks into new concepts. Boyd draws an analogy with calculus: derivatives are deduction, integrals are induction (notice the word roots?).

Boyd might say that PG is describing a startup community synthesizing ideas from too limited a set of “building block” concepts. Too much induction from too little deduction. But Boyd might suggest something even stronger.

When your only background is in reading TechCrunch or VC blogs for 2 hours a day, it is literally impossible for you to come up with something that could not be also randomly generated with a Markov chain of those sources. And, unfortunately for you, TechCrunch and VC blogs are only an extremely limited view of all possible startups and you’ll inevitably miss out on possible world-changing startup ideas (bonus points: this is [Godel’s first incompleteness theorem!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems))

I firmly believe the only way to create a world-changing company is to approach the startup system from the outside. IMVU looked at Lean Manufacturing and saw that concepts which had been applied to manufacturing could also be applied to new product development. Google looked at graph theory and used it to find [a way to index the entire internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank). Apple took [Zen concepts of attention](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/buddhist-practice/attention.html) and used it make beautiful devices.

It won’t pay off immediately, but most things in life don’t. It took Steve 10 years from getting a job at Atari to release the Mac, and 30 years to release his greatest achievement: the iPhone and iOS.

So when I spend a week grappling with a sentence or two of Wittgenstein or Ackoff, I don’t consider it a waste. Not everyone reading this has to go drop acid, but I would encourage you to pick up a book by a great thinker like [Heisenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle), or contemplate one of the great artists like [Sol LeWitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt), or watch a masterpiece of cinema like Tarkovsky’s [Stalker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_(film)).

Maybe your conceptual-art-meets-enterprise software startup doesn’t get off the ground. I guess a drunkard’s walk won’t always be a straight line to success, no matter how wide and deep your corpus is.

At least it might make TechCrunch a little more interesting.
