According to Andrew, you should "outsource your monetization” and “focus on building great products”. Andrew goes on to say that the more important question than “how will they make money?” is “how will this product retain 100 million active users?”

100 million active users. If I’m getting this right, the advice here is to “just get 100 million users” (oh yeah, that’s really easy), and then just slap some ads on that shit.

Andrew didn’t have the benefit in May of getting the public market’s opinion on this business model, but let’s take a quick look - since open, FB’s down 50%, GRPN -84%, Zynga -70%, Yelp -10%, Pandora -10%.

Hmmm.

Other than the flippancy of “just get 100m active users” (that would put you in the top 25 websites worldwide, by the way), there’s clearly something wrong with this. Andrew’s “strategy” is to build something that grabs a lot of attention, and then try to sell that attention to someone else.

Priests of the New Bubble will try to convince you that “it’s different this time” - usually, they trot around the statistic that there are now 2 billion people online, which is approximately a jillion more than in 1999. So, clearly, the problem with 1999 was the the market wasn’t big enough, and now it is! Excellent!

Except, think about today’s internet user versus the one in 1999. In 1999, how many genuinely awesome sites were there on the internet? I guess Yahoo was kinda nice back then. But today, you have to divide your online attention between Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Foursquare, Tumblr, OkCupid, BuzzFeed, Branch, and a few thousand other startups I’m forgetting.

The market for attention has gotten 10x as big since 1999, but its also become 100x as competitive. App fatigue is real. A home screen can only hold so many icons.

The problem with a “just build a great product” strategy is that it assumes that all created value can be captured. Bubble 2.0 investors depended on the value created by networks to create a defensible company, but we’re watching that fail. Twitter, in an attempt to extract value from their network, has started to cut off the API developers who ‘aren’t adding value to the Twitter platform.’ Foursquare and Tumblr both seem to be spinning their wheels with regards to monetization, because they’re all realizing “just slap ads on it” isn’t going to work. Their 'alternative monetization strategies’ end up pitiful jokes - if someone at Tumblr really thinks that their $1 “promoted post” mechanic is a real business model, they should quit tomorrow. Foursquare’s partnership-based strategy doesn’t look like it’s going to scale, either.

Audiences can be gained and lost in a fortnight. Everyone’s talking about how quickly a startup can get to 100m users, but you don’t hear anyone talking about how easy it is to lose that same audience just as fast. Doubt it? Ask Kevin Rose. Or those Highlight guys. And an easily-lost network, a network that scatters at the first sign of advertising - that’s a network without much value at all.

The companies that will survive this bubble will resemble the same ones that outlasted the last one - defensible businesses with unique business models. Google captured purchase intent and sold it to the highest bidder. Amazon brought the entire world of retail to your doorstep. Apple sold amazing electronics.

And you know what? “Outsourcing monetization” has got to be the worst oxymoron I’ve ever heard. The purpose of a business is to make money, and it doesn’t take a business school degree to know that you outsource to reduce costs, not to raise revenue.

I guess you could try to “just get 100m users” and flip your company. But what seems a hell of a lot easier to me than trying to build the next 'top 25’ website on the internet? Asking people to pay.

'Just put AdSense on it’ was bad advice then, and it’s bad advice now.
