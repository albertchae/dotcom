We may have lost our way as a community.

Phew. I said it. OK. Listen, I don’t want to come off as an
always-contrarian, no-one-invited-me-to-the-cool-kid-party type, but I think the
startup party limo may be headed in the wrong direction.

## Setting the stage: beauty pageants and pump'n'dump

If you’ve ever read anything written by a 37signals employee, you know how much
they hate the traditional world of startup investors and tech press. DHH wrote
about the TechCrunch debacle:

Nobody has covered the beauty pageant of startup contestants and venture judges
better than TechCrunch. They not only cheered on a generation of Silicon Valley
dolls to dress their finest for the pump’n’dump cycle, they fucking owned the
barn where the show was held.

This is just one of many similar comments they’ve made on VCs and angels.
Anti-investment talk can sound like the cries of a spurned lover - I’m sure
every startup that failed to raise money and went out of business salves the
ego by saying that “being fundable” is a bad thing. But, 37signals makes a
lot of money. They don’t have to worry about investors (or offending them).

So I started to notice some things that disturb me.

## Techstars - startups are sexy now!

Techstars has a show on Bloomberg TV. Does this not ring alarm bells for anyone?
As Eric Ries has pointed out many times before, the real work in a startup is
not sexy, it is not cool, and it is very boring:

The real entrepreneurship - not the caricature from pop culture and mass media -
is boring, tedious, and extremely difficult. It’s anything but cool:
product prioritization meetings, deciding which customers to listen to and which
to ignore, and valiantly trying to keep the vision alive in the face of contradictory facts.

Even if you think Techstars is smartly doing the show for “publicity”, what
kind of person are they going to attract to Techstars with a glitzed-up TV show?

In addition, the recent announcement of additional “guaranteed” money for
Techstars firms at not exactly stellar terms has add even more sex to the whole
shebang. The terms are so bad, in fact, that some have postulated that not takingthe money would be a positive signal to serious investors. After personally seeing a few
Techstars startups struggle to raise financing and some fold two weeks after
the program ended, is anyone at Techstars HQ wondering if the priorities have been set correctly?

Even Techstars mentors are worried about the revenue models of the incubator’s
startups.

## VC blogs - welcome to the human centipede

A lot of VCs are blogging now, Fred Wilson being the prototype of the genre.
Nothing inherently wrong about that, of course. But it creates some strange
incentives and situations, and I’m not sure would-be founders understand what’s
happening. To be clear, I have nothing against VCs with blogs. I have a
problem with people who take VC blogs at face value.

A venture capitalist with a successful blog has a strong incentive to promote
his portfolio on his blog. For example, Fred gets nearly 60-80k visits per month.
If you’ve got a consumer-targeted portfolio company, that’s too good a promotional
opportunity to ignore. So you talk about how great your portfolio is.
Again, nothing wrong about that.

But I see entrepreneurs take it the wrong way. When Fred blogs about canv.as,
he’s promoting it so you’ll sign up. I’ve seen way too many entrepreneurs take
the message as: “USV invests in startups like canv.as…to get funded, I’ll need
to make something like it.” This isn’t, of course, true. USV has a lot of boring
portfolio companies which never get talked about, even if they’re doing well:
Simulmedia, Return Path, Workmarket. They’re not consumer internet, so the VCs
see no point in blogging about them.

The tech blogs make it worse. TechCrunch and Mashable constantly cover sexy
consumer internet startups because their readers are consumers. It’s simply more
interesting to read about the latest photo-sharing startup than the latest
back-office deal processing startup. You never hear about the rest of the
ecosystem because it doesn’t make for good press.

So the budding entrepreneur thinks: “well gosh, to get USV and TechCrunch to
notice me I have to build a sexy consumer web startup like Turntable or Chill!"
Is it any wonder, then, that reading TechCrunch you think "hmmm…haven’t I seen
this before?”

There’s an excess of respect for investors in the startup field at the moment.
But the real reason everyone loves the big-name VCs and praises their companies
isn’t because they’re great companies - it’s mostly brown-nosing. In private
onversations with founders, I was struck by the way they talked about prominent
startup investors off the record. “But you can’t come out and disagree with
investor name publicly, because you might want his money later.” So because we
don’t want to “bite the hand that feeds us,” we don’t call them out. I considered
not publishing this post for that reason. I guess we’ll see what happens.

## DEMO and TC Disrupt - the pageant, live!

I was recently at the DEMO conference in SF, as part of my job as
Hacker-in-Residence (lol) at Gust. (Disclaimer: the following are my views,
not the views of my former employer).

The companies were fucking boring.

Almost everything on stage seemed like “this plus that” or “foursquare for
zoo animals!” In speaking to the entrepreneurs afterward, it seemed like they
thought they were merely doing what the VCs wanted them to do. Were they?

I think a lot of founders regretted going to DEMO or TC Disrupt, like Openera did.

## Tech bubble - the VC crunchdown into the Angel space

Essentially, we’re dealing with an early stage market that’s flooded with money.
VCs have decided to attack the angel space head on, making smaller and smaller
investments earlier and earlier. In addition, VCs are raising more and more
capital as returns in the public equities markets and bond markets stagnate.

This may be the most “sustainable” part of the current early-stage bubble,
and the reason it could stay around for a while. I’m not sure I see any reason
the VCs will move back to the stage of the funding ecosystem where they were
in 1999. Startups are cheaper than ever, and if VCs want to play the game
they’re going to need to be content with earlier stage investments. Others have
written more intelligently than me about the effects and causes of the VC flood,
but suffice it to say that I think they’ll be around for at least the next 3-5 years.

And for as long as this money-flood sticks around, we’re going to see a lot of
“me-too” startups get funded that shouldn’t be. I’ve sat in on way too many
pitches that were clearly intentionally “sexed up” with terms and buzzwords
that the entrepreneur thinks the investor wants to hear. I’ve even seen it work.

## Creating market value, not customer value

Sit back, and think for a minute on this one: does a VC or angel care about a
given startups EBITDA?

Nope (not directly). These are investors, and they’re looking for a return on
their investment. And market valuations are driven increasingly less by revenues
and more by userbases. An investor is looking to maximize total enterprise value
to maximize the eventual sale of the business, not to maximize the bottom line.

VCs and angels don’t invest in services businesses for that reason. Services
businesses revenue multiples just aren’t that great. They probably even make
more money with less risk than product companies. Never forget that most
investors are in the business of selling companies, and they will fund what’s sellable.

This is what gives rise to “feature-not-a-company.” Strategic buyers like
Google will pay for features that can be integrated into their larger offering.
They don’t need revenue models: they already have one.

## Built to flip? What about built to fund?

There’s an old insult in the startup community: “that’s built to flip.” It’s
thrown at a startup that seems too sexy, that sold too early. But, I agree with
investor Basil Peters that exits will only get smaller and earlier, a thesis
he enumerates in Early Exits.

(Side note: I mentioned my love for that book to another founder. He discouraged
me from saying that too loudly: apparently, the book is disliked among the
VC community (?) because it implies that VCs are going to be pushed out as exits
get smaller. Smaller exits don’t make sense for a VC investment strategy
(they need bigger returns) but make great sense for angels.)

## Only 14% of the Inc. 500 is venture-backed.

It occurs to me there might be an even more important insult, one that
founders should take seriously: being “built to fund.”
