In June of 2016, I received an email:

> Dear sir: I'm from Syria , expected to graduate this semester (Computer Science) , and as you sir my role model in Ruby also Rails , I need some advice about open source projects in Ruby to learn from. Thanks in advance and sorry if I waste your time

Actually, he wasn't *just* in Syria. He was at the University of Aleppo. His name was Mohammed.

At this point, the [Syrian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War) had been raging in Aleppo for almost four years. One tenth of the total deaths of the war so far have happened in Aleppo. When Mohammed wrote this email in 2016, the tide was just starting to turn in favor of Assad's forces. You would be forgiven if, like me, you thought that life did not go on inside of a warzone, especially in a city where entire city blocks had been leveled to dust. But, it does - although life is hard, life goes on.

The [veil of ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance) had been stripped away. Here was someone my age, on the other side of the world, with the same interests as I do, but living in an actual warzone. He played video games with his friends, like I do, enjoyed programming in Ruby on Rails, like I do, but [his university was being bombed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_University_bombings).

Mohammed and I continued corresponding. He never asked for anything except advice, and that was all I gave (or really, could give).

In January of this year, Mohammed fled Syria and made it to Turkey, where he is officially a Syrian refugee.

I'll turn it over to Mohammed to let him tell you his story. Mohammed's English is pretty good, but I did edit this section for readability and clarity.

## Enter Mohammed

My name is Mohammed Elias Al-Hussein. I was born and raised in Qamishli, Syria. Qamishli is in northeastern Syria, right on the border with Turkey. Before the civil war, in 2011, about 200,000 people lived there. Since then, refugees from other cities and Iraq have grown the city to over 500,000 people. I have a big, happy family: my Mom, Dad, 2 amazing brothers and 5 beautiful sisters. All of them still in Qamishli, except one sister in the UAE.

When I was growing up, I got the dream to be a game developer after playing Project I.G.I. Later, I was fascinated by the Internet, and got to know how the internet works. I started reading about webpages and very basic HTML in secondary school.

When I was in the 11th grade, I remember watching a TV show about Japan. The show talked about the culture, Japan's technology sector, as well as the anime and manga like Death Note and Detective Conan. This really fed my imagination. After all of this, I made a promise to complete my graduate studies in Japan.

After a while, I studied very hard to get 94% at the high school’s final exam. In Syria, you have to score higher on this exam than a particular score to enter certain fields of study at the university level. At that time, the minimum requirements for studying computer science at the University of Aleppo was 92.8%. I was accepted and went to study there in September 2010.

In the spring of 2011, the Arab Spring spread to Syria. That summer, the civil war began.

On January 15 2013, Aleppo University was bombed. 82 people were killed and 160 were injured. Shortly after, while travelling back to Al-Qamishli to my family, I was kidnapped by thugs. I was in captivity for 32 days, 7 hours and about 21 minutes. I know because I counted them, second by second. The gang that kidnapped me released me after forcing my family to pay a ransom of about $12,000 US. Well, this was my savings to travel to Japan, and since the Syrian Lira had inflated so much since the war started it was even worse. After that, I missed the first semester exam. It was on January 31 and that was during the captivity.

Aleppo was getting very bad at this time. There was no safe road to exit or enter Aleppo. In addition, if the faculty left or the university shut down, I would immediately be drafted into military service for the Assad regime. I started looking for ways to leave Syria. I emailed every foreign embassy on Earth to complete my undergraduate study. They all refused me because I did not have refugee status with the UNHCR.

I started working in a dessert shop for 13 hours a day for 6 days a week for $70 US a month. I was thinking about trying to build my savings again so I could leave, but I knew it was crazy. I would need to work for 14 years at this rate. It was during this dark time that I understood that no one will care about you if you don’t prove to them who you are and show them your soul as a fighter, dreamer - clever and ambitious. It was during this period that I felt like I was reborn as a programmer and self-learner. I feel like I proved to my teachers and supervisors at the University, too, that despite the circumstances with no fresh water, no food, no electricity and no internet I could be a world-class engineer.

At this time (2014) I was at the third of five years in my studies. I started learning Japanese in the Japanese Language Center at Aleppo University, which was in a bad state because of the situation in Aleppo. All of the teachers were volunteers.

The situation forced me to study for the university and work as a computer maintainer Al Jamelaiah, which is the "IT zone" of Aleppo. I started playing with Unity, but I couldn't finish a game. We only had 2 hours of electricity a day at this time, and we didn't even know when those 2 hours would be.

In the summer I got in touch with a friend in Turkey asking him about making real games. He told me to look at mobile development or web development instead, because my school wouldn't accept a video game as my final project. I eventually found Ruby and Rails, which I enjoyed very much. After a few months of struggling with little electricity and no internet, I found some online courses, read some books and a partner and I decided to build a social network with Rails.

We struggled a lot to build the social network. For one three month period there wasn't any internet access in Aleppo at all. After that I reached my final year of studies. For my final project, we built a face recognition server using Ruby and OpenCV. We built the server with very poor hardware and without any fancy cameras or good processors, but it worked. After we finished the app the accuracy was about 81-84% due to poor processing power.

By the end of 2016, I finished 5 levels of Japanese, took a preparation course for the IELTS (a standardized test for English proficiency), and finished my Computer Science degree.

In Syria, military service is compulsory for males over the age of 18 who are not in school. My exemption from service would expire after my graduation in March of 2017. I decided to leave Syria before that happened, before I could get caught by Assad’s regime and turned into a cold-blood killer or to be killed by his mercenaries.

In December of 2016, I crossed the border to Turkey after a very tough journey. 3 weeks later, I got a job as a junior iOS developer in a small office in Istanbul. I work 50 hours per week for about $430 per month. After 5 months I moved to Bursa, a smaller and cheaper city than Istanbul, where I got another job in a more reliable office than the previous one for $500 per month.

Now, I am trying to immigrate to Canada. It is my dream to live somewhere peacefully with different races, cultures and religions. It is important to me that everyone is treated as a human being.

My name is Mohammed Elias Al-Hussein - let’s explain it word by word: Mohammed, for Sunni Muslims, stands for the prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Elias is my father's name and in the Christian Syriac language (Syriac Aramaic) it means Elijah. Al-Hussein is for Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of Muhammad (pbuh), who is very important for Shia Muslims. My name has all the basic materials of Syrian society. I have promised my mom to name my son Sam to add the Jewish component to my name.

I have been wondering: what’s the purpose of creating me and making me struggle to obtain even the most basic human rights? I believe the answer would be to fight and use my knowledge as engineer on behalf of the poor, the disabled, and the refugees all over the world. From the bottom of my heart, I want to make the world better place. I don't know where I will be after 5 years, but I'm going to tell you something: I will do my best to be a world-class engineer to help others. I'm taking Google's CEO position into consideration!

## What's Next and How You Can Help

Mohammed is out of the frying pan, but he's not out of the fire yet. If you've been following the news, you know that Turkey's future is in doubt. After some discussion, Mohammed thinks his best chance at a safe and steady life and career is to **immigrate to Canada**. Canada has an extensive refugee immigration program, and I know there are a lot of companies there that might want to help.

For a refugee who cannot return to their country due to civil war, [there are a few conditions](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/outside/index.asp) you have to meet before you can apply to immigrate to Canada:

* **"You must be outside your home country."** Mohammed is in Turkey.
* **"You have been seriously affected by civil war or armed conflict"** Hopefully obvious from the above.
* **"You will still need the UNHCR, a referral organization, or a private sponsorship group to refer you."** The UNHCR protects refugees who are fleeing persecution based on their race, ethnicity or other status, which Mohammed is not (he's in the [Member of the Country of Asylum class](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/ref-sponsor/section-2.asp#a2.1)). He will need a private sponsor.

The reason why I've written this post is to help Mohammed find a private sponsor. In Canada, you can do that through two ways: by forming a [Group of Five](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/sponsor/groups.asp), private citizens and permanent residents of Canada who all live in the same city and pledge to help the refugee they sponsor to resettle in Canada. The second way is a [Community Sponsor](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/sponsor/community.asp), which can be a corporation or community organization.

All private sponsorships entail financial and non-financial support, for the period of about a year or until Mohammed becomes self-sufficient. Since Mohammed is a junior computer programmer, hopefully that won't take very long. For more about what a sponsor has to do, [check out Canada's official explanation of the role of a sponsor.](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/ref-sponsor/section-2.asp#a2.6)

If you are a permanent resident of Canada (and, uh, [haven't murdered anybody](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/ref-sponsor/section-2.asp#a2.4)) interested in helping Mohammed resettle in Canada, please let Mohammed know by contacting him through this form.

If you are a Canadian corporation and want to help, you can contact Mohammed through this form. Mohammed has experience as a Ruby and iOS developer, and is currently working both at an iOS shop and with me on some Ruby projects. Here's his resume. I think he would be a great asset to any Canadian employer.

In addition, if you live in *any* country whose immigration laws might allow someone like Mohammed immigrate, and you think you could help - please do get in contact.
