<h4>The Rails Performance Apocrypha</h4>
<p>... was <a href="gum.co/apocrypha">published!</a> Yay!</p>

<h4>Sidekiq in Practice</h4>
<p>
  I'm working on a new educational product that focuses purely on Sidekiq. It's a multimedia/hands-on course delivered via CLI that teaches you how to scale Sidekiq from 0 to 10,000 jobs per second.
