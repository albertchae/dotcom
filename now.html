<h4>Sidekiq in Practice</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://nateberk.gumroad.com">It's finally out!</a>. It's a multimedia/hands-on course delivered via CLI that teaches you how to scale Sidekiq from 0 to 10,000 jobs per second. It's almost done!

<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I've really enjoyed contracting with them for the last six months and look forward to doing even more.
