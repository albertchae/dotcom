<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Taos, New Mexico. 
</p>

<h4>Sidekiq in Practice</h4>
<p>
  I'm working on a new educational product that focuses purely on Sidekiq. It's a multimedia/hands-on course delivered via CLI that teaches you how to scale Sidekiq from 0 to 10,000 jobs per second. It's almost done!
</p>
  
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Playing a lot of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/">Space Engineers</a></li>
  <li>Playing 5E DnD with some friends online. We're using Ravnica as a setting - I'm a Goblin Izzet Sorcerer!</li>
  <li>Riding Peloton nearly every day.</li>
</ul>
