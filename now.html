<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>
  
<h4>Taking care of my new daughter, Sky</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/nateberkopec/status/1749977456889790591">I’m happy to announce that the next version of Puma will be “Sky’s Version”</a>
</p>

<h4>Riding my bike even more than before</h4>
<p>
  I'm aiming for 600 hours of riding in 2024. I'm currently working through a bit of fatigue on the bike at the moment. 
</p>
  
<h4>Avaiable for work again!</h4>
<p>
  My long-term engagement with Gusto is now complete, so I'm available to optimize your Ruby on Rails application!
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Having a lot of fun with my two-year old daughter.</li>
  <li>We bought a car finally, so we get to drive the kids around.</li>
  <li>It's hot as hell here in Tokyo.</li>
</ul>
