<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Tokyo, Japan.
</p>
  
<h4>We moved to Japan!</h4>
<p>
  After almost 2 years of planning, we finally finished moving! We are looking for a long-term rental now.
</p>
  
<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I'm slowly working on speeding up their main pages.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Still slightly shocked that Vingegaard won the TdF</li>
  <li>Being a proud dad.</li>
</ul>
