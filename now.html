<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Tokyo. I'm applying for a business visa and hope to be here for a while.
</p>
  
<h4>Self-Expander</h4>
  
<p>
  Inspired by Derek Sivers, I made something called the <a href="https://www.selfexpander.com/">Self Expander</a>.
</p>

<h4>Growing</h4>

I am:

<ul>
<li>Learning Japanese. I plan to take the JLPT N5 at some point, maybe December.</li>
<li>Learning to draw. I'm using <a href="https://drawabox.com/">Drawabox.</a></li>
<li>Taking a break from social media. Trying to use less Twitter, Reddit. Deactivated Facebook. Trying [Mailbrew](https://app.mailbrew.com/).</li>
<li>Meditating daily. Roughly 10 minutes per day, using the Waking Up app.</li>
</ul>
