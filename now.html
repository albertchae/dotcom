<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>
  
<h4>Riding my bike even more than before</h4>
<p>
  Pretty much all of my free time not spent with my kiddo is spent on the bike lately. I'm training hard for a race this month. You should <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/33158316">follow me on Strava</a>.
</p>
  
<h4>Buckling down for a new baby</h4>
<p>
  We're due for an addition to our family in January. We're getting everything ready!
</p>
  
<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. Currently we're working on making the experience for big companies even better.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Having a lot of fun with my two-year old daughter.</li>
  <li>Competing in some small local bike races in the central Japan area, in the beginner classes.</li>
  <li>ゆっくり日本語を勉強しています</li>
</ul>
