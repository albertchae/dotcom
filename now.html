<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>
  
<h4>Watching the Vuelta a Espana</h4>
<p>
  I think I'm turning into a bit of Remco fan.
</p>
  
<h4>I'm cycling... a lot</h4>
<p>
  If you like to ride bikes, you should <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/33158316">follow me on Strava</a>. I've been racing recently too!
</p>
  
<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. Currently we're working on making the experience for big companies even better.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Having a lot of fun with my two-year old daughter.</li>
  <li>Competing in some small local bike races in the central Japan area, in the beginner classes.</li>
  <li>Getting my ass kicked by Armored Core 6</li>
</ul>
