<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Taos, New Mexico.

<h4>Sidekiq in Practice</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://nateberk.gumroad.com">It's finally out!</a>. It's a multimedia/hands-on course delivered via CLI that teaches you how to scale Sidekiq from 0 to 10,000 jobs per second. It's almost done!

<h4>A baby on the way!</h4>

  <a href="https://twitter.com/nateberkopec/status/1427322303990272002">My wife and I are expecting any day now - by the time you read this, she's probably already out.</a>
</p>
  
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Playing Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
  <li>Trying to get back on my daily exercise game (doing OK)</li>
  <li>Ogling the new Corvette Z06</li>
</ul>
