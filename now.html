<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Taos, New Mexico. 
</p>

<h4>Sidekiq in Practice</h4>
<p>
  I'm working on a new educational product that focuses purely on Sidekiq. It's a multimedia/hands-on course delivered via CLI that teaches you how to scale Sidekiq from 0 to 10,000 jobs per second. It's almost done!
</p>
<p>
  It's been a little delayed but I swear it will be done soon!
</p>
  
<h4>Lots of Consulting</h4>
<p>
  The pandemic budget freeze has thawed... and I'm booked out!
</p>
  
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Following the Tour De France</li>
  <li>Not sleeping so well :( Allergies?</li>
  <li>Staying home until the end of the month</li>
</ul>
