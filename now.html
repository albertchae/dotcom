<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>
  
  
<h4>I'm headed to the USA</h4>
<p>
  I'll be doing a private workshop in San Diego and then heading to Railsconf in ATL.
</p>
  
<h4>We moved to Japan!</h4>
<p>
  We now live in Tokyo in a neighborhood called Denenchofu. It's lovely!
</p>
  
<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I'm slowly working on speeding up their main pages.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>... a half marathon runner! Yay! I'm still working on increasing my cycling FTP and my 3 core lifts (deadlift, squat, bench).</li>
  <li>Roleplaying as AG2R Citroen pro cycling team on Pro Cycling Manager 2022.</li>
  <li>Reading (on audiobook) Peter Attia's Outlive.</li>
</ul>
