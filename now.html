<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>
  
  
<h4>I went to Singapore!</h4>
<p>
  I gave a workshop on Rails perf at my new client Sephora.
</p>
  
<h4>We moved to Japan!</h4>
<p>
  We now live in Tokyo in a neighborhood called Denenchofu. It's lovely!
</p>
  
<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I'm slowly working on speeding up their main pages.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Working on reaching a few physical fitness targets: 3 w/kg on the bike, bench/squat/deadlift 3RM combined of 220kg, running a half marathon.</li>
  <li>Enjoying time at home with family until a trip to the US in late April.</li>
  <li>Reading (on audiobook) Christopher Hitchens' God is not Great.</li>
</ul>
