<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Prescott, Arizona.
</p>
  
<h4>We're moving to Japan!</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/nateberkopec/status/1523740088198483971">While my visa is approved, we're waiting for my daughter + wife's visas to be approved. Moving sometime in August.</a>
</p>
  
<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I'm slowly working on speeding up their main pages.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Still trying to build a homelab with k8s and terraform</li>
  <li>Watching my baby learn something new every day</li>
</ul>
