<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>

  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I've really enjoyed contracting with them for the last six months and look forward to doing even more.

  <li>Going skiing</li>
  <li>Staring at my baby</li>
</ul>
