<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Prescott, Arizona for the holidays. I normally live in Tokyo.
</p>
  
  
<h4>I spoke at RubyConf Thailand</h4>
<p>
  It's nice to be speaking at conferences again. The videos aren't up yet but my slides are <a href="https://twitter.com/nateberkopec/status/1601072084129837057">here.</a> 
</p>

  
<h4>We moved to Japan!</h4>
<p>
  We now live in Tokyo in a neighborhood called Denenchofu. It's lovely!
</p>

<h4>I recently ran a 10k race in 47 minutes!</h4>

<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I'm slowly working on speeding up their main pages.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Relaxing with family in the States.</li>
  <li>Heading to RubyConf AU in February and Railsconf in April.</li>
  <li>Being a proud dad.</li>
</ul>
