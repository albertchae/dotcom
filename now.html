<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Taos, New Mexico. 
</p>

<h4>Sidekiq in Practice</h4>
<p>
  I'm working on a new educational product that focuses purely on Sidekiq. It's a multimedia/hands-on course delivered via CLI that teaches you how to scale Sidekiq from 0 to 10,000 jobs per second. It's almost done!
</p>
<p>
  It's been a little delayed but I swear it will be done soon!
</p>
  
<h4>A baby on the way!</h4>

<h4>Considering a Real Job</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/nateberkopec/status/1432429404953604096">I'm asking around and seeing what's available.</a>
</p>
  
I am:

<ul>
  <li>(Still) playing a lot of Magic: The Gathering Arena</li>
  <li>(Still) not sleeping so well :(</li>
</ul>
