  We now live in Tokyo in a neighborhood called Denenchofu. It's lovely!

<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I'm slowly working on speeding up their main pages.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Doing my best to make new friends in Tokyo</li>
  <li>Planning a trip to RailsConf next spring and seeing if I can get to Rubyconf AU too...</li>
  <li>Being a proud dad.</li>
</ul>
