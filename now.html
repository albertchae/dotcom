<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Taos, New Mexico. 
</p>

<h4>Settling In</h4>
  
<p>
  We moved back to Taos after ~18 months away. I'm getting re-integrated with the community - volunteering again, seeing old friends, etc. 
</p>

  
<h4>The Rails Performance Workshop</h4>
  
<p>
  After a few beta customers this summer, I'm working on making the Rails Performance Workshop publicly available for all, online.
</p>
  
<h4>Puma 5.0</h4>
  
<p>
  I recently released Puma 5.0 - I hope all of you enjoy!
</p>
  
I am:

<ul>
<li>Meditating daily. Roughly 10 minutes per day, using the Waking Up app.</li>
<li>Running more or less daily.</li>
<li>Thinking about narcissism.</h4>
<li>Doing a lot of home improvement projects around our new house.</li>
</ul>
