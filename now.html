<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Mexico City.
</p>

<h4>The Rails Performance Workshop</h4>

<p>
  I'm running my workshop on making Rails apps faster for about 75 people this month.
  It's going really well! I've given this workshop so many times and I love making
  it a little bit better every time.
</p>

<h4>A Secret Product</h4>

<p>
  Planning and scheming about the next step in my business.
</p>

<h4>Growing</h4>

I am:

<ul>
<li>Learning Japanese. I plan to take the JLPT N5 at some point.</li>
<li>Fixing my posture. I'm sick of having a computer guy hunch, so I'm working on strengthening my back and neck muscles.</li>
<li>Writing regularly. Roughly 500 words per day, but any amount counts.</li>
<li>Meditating daily. Roughly 10 minutes per day, using the Waking Up app.</li>
</ul>
