<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>
  
<h4>Watching the Tour de France</h4>
<p>
  Currently enjoying the greatest race in cycling.
</p>
  
<h4>We moved to Japan!</h4>
<p>
  We now live in Tokyo in a neighborhood called Denenchofu. It's lovely!
</p>
  
<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I'm slowly working on speeding up their main pages.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Riding my bike quite a bit more. <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/33158316">Follow me on Strava.</a></li>
  <li>Competing in some small local bike races in the central Japan area, in the beginner classes.</li>
