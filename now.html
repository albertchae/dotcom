<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently in Tokyo, Japan.
</p>
  
<h4>We moved to Japan!</h4>
<p>
  We're <i>still</i> looking for an apartment though, after a month of searching. Ouch.
</p>
  
<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I'm slowly working on speeding up their main pages.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Following the Vuelta de Espana mostly by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LanterneRougeCycling">Lanterne Rouge.</a></li>
  <li>Dilligently doing my WaniKani every day.</li>
  <li>Being a proud dad.</li>
</ul>
