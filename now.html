<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>
  
<h4>Taking care of my new daughter, Sky</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/nateberkopec/status/1749977456889790591">I’m happy to announce that the next version of Puma will be “Sky’s Version”</a>
</p>

<h4>Playing on my new Nintendo 64</h4>
<p>
  I've been hit with a bit of video game nostalgia. I've got GoldenEye, Ocarina of Time, Mario Party 3, Mario Kart, Wave Race, Yoshi Story, Mario Golf, Super Smash Bros and Starfox 64! 
</p>
  
<h4>Avaiable for work again!</h4>
<p>
  I recently launched a retainer service, and it looks like I'm booked out through the end of 2024. A good problem to have :)
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Having a lot of fun with my two-year old daughter.</li>
  <li>We bought a car finally, so we get to drive the kids around.</li>
  <li>It's hot as hell here in Tokyo.</li>
</ul>
