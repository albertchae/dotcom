<h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
<h2>Nate Berkopec</h2>

<p>
  I am currently living in Tokyo.
</p>
  
  
<h4>I went to Niseko!</h4>
<p>
  It's sort of the premier skiing destination resort in Japan. It was awesome! The snow really is as plentiful as they say it is.
</p>
  
<h4>We moved to Japan!</h4>
<p>
  We now live in Tokyo in a neighborhood called Denenchofu. It's lovely!
</p>

<h4>My FTP is now 199 watts!</h4>

<h4>Long-term engagement with Gusto</h4>
<p>
  I've signed a long-term contract with Gusto to improve the full-stack performance of their Rails application. I'm slowly working on speeding up their main pages.
</p>
 
I am:

<ul>
  <li>Tryhing to build my strength up soon. I'm cutting weight first. I still have another 3kg to go to my target.</li>
  <li>Heading to RubyConf AU in February and Railsconf in April.</li>
  <li>Being a proud dad.</li>
</ul>
